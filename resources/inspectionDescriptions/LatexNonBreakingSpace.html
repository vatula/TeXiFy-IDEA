When referencing something, non-breaking spaces should be used to prevent the label splitting up from the number.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
    Using a non-breaking space makes sure that your reference's label does not get split up from its number.

    For example: <tt>Figure~\ref{fig:fizz}</tt> will become <tt>Figure 3</tt> instead of possibly <tt>Figure<br>3</tt>.
