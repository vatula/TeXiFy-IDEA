Number ranges should use an en dash (<tt>–</tt>) instead of any other dash/hyphen.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
    The en dash is used to represent a span or range of numbers, dates, or time.
    There should be no space between the en dash and the adjacent material.
    Depending on the context, the en dash is read as “to” or “through.”
