<tt>\def</tt> and <tt>\let</tt> are TeX primitves and their use is discouraged.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
    The usage of TeX primitives will often result in unwanted behaviour, especially when the exact workings are not known.
</p>
<p>
    <tt>\def</tt> is a TeX primitive, <tt>\newcommand</tt> is a LaTeX overlay on top of <tt>\def</tt>.
    The most obvious benefits of <tt>\newcommand</tt> over <tt>\def</tt> are:
</p>
<ol>
    <li><tt>\newcommand</tt> checks whether or not the command already exists</li>
    <li><tt>\newcommand</tt> allows you to define an optional argument</li>
</ol>
<p>
    In general, anything that <tt>\newcommand</tt> does can be done by <tt>\def</tt>,
    but it usually involves a little trickery and unless you want something that <tt>\newcommand</tt> can't do,
    there's no point in reinventing the wheel.
